# Best adventure is shared adventure (⚓️,⚓️ )

GM to all the Innovatoooors, the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes… the ones who see things differently like ZEUS & all the ohmies embracing our (⚓️,⚓️) culture. Every revolutionary and innovator looks naive before proving most wrong. You know it’s crazy early, when even people in crypto don’t get OHM yet. We shared our [strong conviction in April 2021](https://twitter.com/livethelifetv/status/1384090249299521538). Being called out for ponzi is no fun, but it kept us sharp and motivated to research, read, write, and document our journey. You know you're building on the frontier if you’re excited as fuck, scared shitless, no idea what the future holds, but extremely passionate & motivated all at the same time.


# Probably nothing
Mt Olympus is hard to understand and climb but once you make summit, the view is unbelievably clear. Crazy how ohmies might end up becoming the first decentralised Venture Capital DAO because the early stage cohort partners of today are the top 100 coins that OHM has ownership in tomorrow. Soon OHM will have a stake in every protocol that matters. Probably something TBH.

### [He who rises with the wave is not swallowed by it*. Olympus DAO](https://livethelife.tv/olympus-dao/)

Staking rewards on OHM tokens are a part of the current growth phase of the protocol, are used to drive users to grow the total amount of OHM they hold. This is counter to hoping tokens appreciate in value. The perfect currency holds the same purchasing power today as in 50 years.

# From unicorn to whale to octopus
As Olympus grows to immense scale and absorbs the utility, liquidity, and culture of its entire ecosystem, it will serve as the central node of a vast network in which value efficiently, frictionlessly, and purposefully travels throughout its habitat. In the context of DeFI, a giant treasury can only do so much. There's nothing innovative about a giant whale. But add in DAO governance focused on strong monetary policy, efficient capital deployment, creatively applying composability and emphasis on the community? Now we're talking. It's clear that OlympusDAO is building an ecosystem. Using Olympus Pro to build partnerships & cohorts, and the launch of Olympus Incubator to back & build innovative projects. We're still so fricking early.

# Art is the frontend, Defi is the backend

An ERC20 token is a standard used for creating and issuing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts can then be used to create smart property or tokenized assets that people can invest in. ERC stands for "Ethereum request for comment". Plenty of well-known digital currencies use the ERC-20 standard, including Olympus DAO. ERC 20 opened the financial system, ERC 721 opened the cultural system. Our vision is that NFTs (ERC-721) will onboard the next billion people on Defi. I bet the DAO would vote in favor of the treasury collecting NFTs. We need an OlympusDAO museum! Meet Olympus Odyssey!!! If Olympus DAO is New York City, Odyssey DAO is the MoMa. It attracts people to the world's best city and curates the finest artists who represent the quality of Olympus culture. We aim to spotlight upcoming artists and give them an incentive to want to work within our culture while spotlighting the loyalty of Olympus members so that their trust in each other be celebrated.

# Why shouldn't POL also apply to NFTs?
The NFT market cap is over $7 billion and exponentially growing. Imagine an NFTX-like marketplace powered by OHM. OlympusDAO is an economic experiment using game theory principles to solve major issues in DeFi. If successful, OHM could really become the default reserve currency of the metaverse. Our vision: Cool NFT's with magic Defi mechanics. What Defi needs, to be cool, is gamification. Brands & Culture to move around in the Metaverse, so we can all enjoy off-chain assets (don't miss the IRL boat). When that happens, the sky is the limit.

# The next 1M users to OHM

Imagine. Polygon Deployed Fiat on-Ramps via Alchemy Pay. Yep, it's here now. Order your MoverDAO debit card and go from cash to OHM and backward in all of Europe. We're currently brainstorming about a mobile app in @wagmilabsinc hackathon! It will drive adoption, as fiat on and off-ramps are still a huge pain point. The leading NFT platform OpenSea has around half a million users, the leading on/off ramp app, CoinBase, has around half a billion users. They are launching an NFT platform, Olympus Odyssey has been buidling one for the past 6 months, WAGMI.

# GameChanger

It’s been called a Ponzi scheme by doubters, a liquidity blackhole by analysts, and a potential future reserve asset by the team behind it. OlympusDAO, with its heavy meme culture, strong community, and innovative tokenomics, has taken the cryptocurrency industry by storm this year. This is more like Bitcoin than you probably realize. Unlimited supply does not have to mean any scarcity. (gitbook)

# Cross-Chain LFG

sOHM is staked OHM. gOHM is wrapped sOHM. You will earn rebase rewards with gOHM across different chains without having to do anything else. gOHM: The non-rebasing wrapper is used to package up staked OHM in a non-rebasing container that can be transferred between chains. gOHM is the first step to V2 migration when $OHM goes fully cross-chain. This innovative idea by ZEUS allows users to hold staked $OHM on other chains without having to pay fees or need to use the Olympus app to do anything. The only fee they would pay is to swap it on a DEX. gOHM is ready and you can start wrapping your $sOHM. If you hold wsOHM on Avax you can now convert it to gOHM on OlympusDAO. With gOHM (governance OHM) out, that means that on-chain governance is right around the corner. Proteus is the rapid bootstrapping of liquidity on other chains with 120k OHM (~$100m) through a cross-chain incentives program.


# Discord fatigue
Anyone else getting discord fatigue? That shit is getting overwhelming. Definitely a great tool. But wow it’s a lot. So much going on at all times! Hard to stay on top of it all for months on end. So we will try hard to filter out the noise and only keep relevant channels unlocked ser. And, add utility to NFT's. The server has been up and running for 18 months now and we started flirting with dunbar's number.

### [Joining uninvited for a drink? <50!](https://livethelife.tv/joining-uninvited-for-a-drink/)

Dunbar explained it informally as “the number of people you would not feel embarrassed about joining uninvited for a drink if you happened to bump into them in a bar. It has been proposed to lie between 100 and 250, with a commonly used value of 150. 50 sounds like magic

# Token curated channels

True multi-chain support for creating channels in Discord is now a reality thanks to guildXYZ. Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche,  xDai, Fantom, Arbitrum, and Harmony are all supported on GuildXYZ!!! Projects like Good Vibes Ohmly, yep that's all of us, aka GVO, can now create token curated channels where users can hold NFTs on Polygon while their tokens are in their Ethereum wallet. Now all we need is marketing?

### [Earned media beats paid ads](https://livethelife.tv/earned-media/)

If you do have to do something promotional, do something unconventional. Publicity stunts, atypical ads, being the first at something. Be noteworthy and contrarian because earned media beats out paid ads, and its way more fun!

# Open IP is such an interesting concept.

For years, companies have spent probably billions of dollars to protect their IP. What if we flip the script and see people making derivatives of IP as an opportunity for free advertising? Why would you ever sell your Ape when you can earn BAYC tokens passively AND probably license out the IP? If you invest in stocks and think NFT’s are stupid, think of it like this. Imagine a company like BoredApeYC that made half a billion dollars in profit in its initial 6 months of going public, we would call that a unicorn in the biz world. $1.3 billion in combined secondary trading volume across all collections since launching in April. Instead of a stock tho, you own art. Your art is in a superstate where it constantly fluctuates between art, proof of ownership, access keys, items (physical and digital), and perceived values. It’s ok to collect NFTs for different reasons, whether it’s the art, the money, the tech, or the membership.
