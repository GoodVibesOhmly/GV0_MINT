## The next big thing after social media

DAOs are communities. They are the next big thing after social media. Web1 allowed everyone to share ideas. Web2 allowed communities to form and discuss those ideas. Web3 will enable those communities to leverage financial capital and go from discussions to action. A token-permissioned DAO is a type of restricted access online community that requires the holding of a certain amount of DAO tokens in order to be part of it, or else they will be booted from the community by a bot on Discord

## A bunch of gigabrain frens

Vibes. Really Good Vibes. The main reason to live the web3 life is feeling surrounded with a talent pool buidling the future backed by a community-owned compounding treasury sometimes seeded by a bunch of gigabrain frens. Rather than companies competing for our time to make them money, DAOs should compete for our time to make contributing a positive and lucrative experience. Corporations are a collection of contracts. DAOs aren’t companies.  They’re networks.  Networks are more valuable than companies. DAOs are a collection of connections, capital, and communications. Being in crypto means you get to talk about - macroeconomics - game theory - art - governance - user experience design  - philosophy - financial strategies ... All in one conversation. Joining a DAO is probably the best education in web3 that you can get. You'll learn firsthand the power of community, the future of work, and why web3 will change the world. Sometimes DAO’s are just a bunch of frens with a treasury deciding to do the most impactful thing possible. DAOs are the future of work. But there are some bosses to beat: Compensation, Coordination, and Compliance.

## Beyond grateful

In any case, we are very thankful that we can count ourselves among the ohmies, and that we found ways to become part of the cultural revolution. Beyond grateful to OlympusDAO. Thank you Ohmies. Without you, there would be no OHM. Without OHM we wouldn’t have been able to sustain this conversation. Thank you for the chats and the laughs. GM to everyone seeing a vision come to life. Beyond grateful for what we've accomplished up until this point and excited for what the future holds. Oh and one more thing, add Fohmo 4 to your calendar; Dec 10th and 12th!! Ohmies are a different breed, can't wait to see where we are in 2022 ... The builders are also doing what they did from start, head down, impervious to fud, building, educating, fostering, and growing. LFG. 33 billion is hardcoded. Ω

## Life is not complicated. WAGMI ser

Write down a few things that you want and take massive action to get it. Let's rock the boat. (⚓️,⚓️ ) style. Imagine web3 with good UX, a compounding treasury to reward the talent pool with skin in the game. Minting a Good Vibes Ohmly NFT automagically stakes GVO tokens and the NFT comes with IRL membership benefits. If you want the best product, make it WAGMI-native. If you want the best community, make it WAGMI-native. It isn’t just hardcore DeFi degens. It’s also creatives. Artists. Builders. Academics. Professionals. It’s for everyone. Like Web3. To run a successful web3 community you need to master: DeFi (liquidity and secondary markets), NFTs  (access and community engagement), and DAOs (governance and operations). This combo takes a project from an experiment to a core foundation for growth. LFG
