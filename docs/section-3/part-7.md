## Who can mint?
Minting will open at Perfect Timing on TBC. Minting will be open to people that secured their spot through boosting or joining the Discord before TBC, 3:33 PM EST. To all of the people who had one-on-one conversations with us, those that spoke with us on voice, and those that aligned themselves.

When about 300 people have secured their spot to mint, minting will be open until all 666 NFTs are sold out, with a max mint of three NFTs, and one max per transaction. There will be 666 NFTs available, with 222 of each NFT design.

There are 999 NFTs in total, 333 are reserved for the treasury & team, 90 of the 333 reserved NFTs will go to the team. This results in a 9% team, 24% treasury, and 67% public split.

## Staking

If you mint the Genesis NFTs, you automagically receive 33 sGVO, rebasing every eight hours compounding at 333,333% APY. Staked sGVO can be unstaked for GVO, which can be sold to the GVO-OHM Sushiswap liquidity pool (LP) at any time. No restrictions, no lock-ups.

## Bonding

Bonding will be available at launch as the second value accrual strategy, the first being the genesis mint, the second is bonds revenue on wETH, sOHM, and GVO-OHM LP bonds.

As a user, be mindful that bonding is an active, short-term strategy and has a vesting term of five days before you can claim and stake your GVO. By selling GVO at a discount, we can acquire reserve assets into our treasury.

## Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL)

The GVO-OHM Sushiswap pool is another revenue stream. By being the largest liquidity provider, we earn most of the fees on swaps in the GVO-OHM liquidity pool.

OHM is our reserve currency (1 GVO is backed by 0.001 OHM), all OHM in treasury is staked (3,3), and all GVO is staked from the beginning by default. We are a brand and Olympus is the bank.

It’s important to note, by using OHM as Good Vibes Ohmly’s reserve currency we get exposure to the best parts of DeFi. They handle the curation of the best assets (wETH, DAI, FRAX, LUSD, CVX, and more) to acquire into their treasury. By acquiring OHM, we automatically get exposure to a basket of the best assets in DeFi. This allows us to simplify Good Vibes Ohmly’s treasury by only holding OHM, ETH, and GVO and focus on core products by choosing Olympus as both the decentralized reserve currency and bank.

GVO is 100% staked at the beginning by the genesis NFT sale also being the GVO sale, and automatically stake 33 sGVO on your behalf per each NFT that you mint. Cooperation is incentivized, to unstake you must pay gas fees.

No doubt it will be a voyage marked by an intellectual wandering of self-discovery. That's it, that's the brain dump draft. Thanks for proofreading. Send feedback ser
