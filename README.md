Here’s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes… the ones who see things differently — they’re not fond of rules… You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can’t do is ignore them because they change things… They push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.

Manifesters,
As of 11/1, at 11:11 AM EST, the stars aligned and with Perfect Timing, the Manifest discord was brought into existence. Visit our discord here. https://discord.gg/mnfst

Manifest does not ask you to be anything other than your true, authentic self. We will always be completely transparent and communicate our intentions.
Our priority is to facilitate a space where you can have meaningful one-on-one conversations with like-minded people because we believe 1 + 1 = 3. Empathy is our advantage.

Self Knowledge + Other Knowledge = Universal Collective Knowledge.

Structure

We believe great communities appear when people feel comfortable being who they are. A place with no barriers or artificial walls — a blank canvas of community.
We designed our discord to facilitate the flow of conversation, with no useless channels. No wasted space, all role colors mean something. All emojis for roles mean something. Everything has a purpose. There is no such thing as a coincidence.

By connecting the dots between our community, we create something higher than ourselves. By creating those bonds, we create a social fabric that can withstand the roller coaster of the cryptocurrency market for the long haul.

We believe by bringing together Visionaries, Creators, and Builders into a shared space, and giving them the freedom to share their work with like-minded people we can kickstart an array of projects giving them a launchpad to do so.

Visionaries in Manifest are the policy planners, strategists, and proposal-makers. You are responsible for the governance of Manifest.
You may find #visionary chat to be focused on sharing the best ideas and information. Curating the best Twitter accounts to follow. The best people to know. The best resources, books, articles, podcasts, and tools for you to self-evolve.

Creators in Manifest are the artists, musicians, and entertainers. You are responsible for the culture of Manifest.
You may find #creators chat to be focused on sharing art that they have created or very much appreciate from others. Curating the best music, the best art, the best content. Give and receive feedback, share your creations and discuss your favorite artists. This is the place for all creative endeavors.
Builders in Manifest are the hackers, the developers, and the structural core of Manifest. You are responsible for the construction of Manifest.
You may find the #builders chat to be focused on sharing code, resources, security measures and more. Curating the best development practices to help build a safe and benevolent future. Here you can learn from the best, develop your skills and share your knowledge, so you can learn to build yourself to the top.
Manifest is DIFY. Do-it-FOR-yourself. We do not want you to give away your power to others, Manifest is about realizing & actualizing your own power. You’ve always had it. Manifest will just help you realize it. Everything is happening FOR you, not to you.

Roles

We care about our collective, we trust you. You are here for a reason. There is no such thing as a coincidence. Our roles are created to evolve you not only through your journey in Manifest, but in your own personal life as well.
Our team roles are the following:

The Vortex — Founding team, responsible for bringing our collective manifestations into existence.
Vibe Curators — Moderators, responsible for curating quality & ensuring everyone feels heard and not just like another name in a sea of usernames.
The community roles are unique, they are selected by our Vibe Curators through one-on-one conversations and by getting to know you in chat and remembering who you are.

Vibe curators have been carefully selected for their immensely elevated souls and we are so grateful to have them be a part of our journey.
Roles are explained below. Higher vibrations have no special perks, besides the ones obtained within. We believe this is the best way to evolve all of our collective to the highest point.

Everyone starts at “Courageous”. They are permitting in their attitude to Manifest, and they believe the power of Manifest is feasible by joining it. They feel affirmation towards themselves to give it a try. This is the process of empowerment, realizing their true potential and power.
Then we go to “Neutral”. They see the value of Manifest, they are enabling it, they contribute to chat, they stick around. They view Manifest as satisfactory, it satisfies them to be there and spend time chatting with people they resonate with. They trust what Manifest can do for them, they are beginning the process of releasing their past biases and belief systems of what is true and what is not.

Next, we go to “Willing”. They begin inspiring others with their work (art, chat history, good vibes, memes, etc.) They are hopeful Manifest can deliver on the claims that it makes and it’s different from the rest of the ecosystem. They feel optimistic about Manifest and are in the process of setting intentions to make it better day by day in whatever way they can.

Moving up, we go to “Accepting”. They feel merciful towards Manifest, compassion, kindness, forgiveness for any minor transgressions that happen in the ebb and flow of life. They view life to be harmonious, everything is connected pleasingly. They feel forgiveness for themselves and towards Manifest for the inevitable disagreements that may arise. They are in the process of transcending higher than themselves, to a larger purpose within Manifest.
Rising yet higher, we go to “Reasoning”. These people are perceived as “wise” to the rest of the Manifest community. They view life at Manifest to be extremely meaningful. They feel understanding towards the true purpose of Manifest and the collective. They are in the process of abstraction, clearing blockages that stand in the way of Manifest’s evolution.

Moving up once again, we go to “Loving”. They are viewed as extremely loving and caring towards the collective & Manifest. They view life at Manifest as benign, favorable, and wholesome. They feel reverence towards Manifest and the collective, profound adoring respect for the mission and the people involved. They are in the process of revelation, sharing profound Truths with a capital T with the collective.

Leveling up, we go to “Joyful”. They are viewed as one with Manifest, they are completely aligned with the collective and spirit. They view life at Manifest as complete, with no sense of lack. They feel the serenity at Manifest and radiate the same energy. They are in the process of transfiguration, visually experiencing the changes that they, and Manifest have brought to their own lives.

Continuing up only, we go to “Peaceful”. They are viewed as all-being at Manifest, their presence is natural and omnipresent, you can directly point to the fruits of their creation for Manifest. They view life at Manifest as perfect, and exactly the way it should be. They feel bliss at Manifest, it is a paradise, heaven, and source of complete happiness. They are in the process of illumination, intellectual & spiritual enlightenment.

The final rank, we go to “Enlightenment”. This is a misunderstood word, usually perceived as unattainable and with many biases and preconceptions attached. Every single one of you can achieve enlightenment. This is viewing life for what it is. Feeling ineffable emotions too great to be described or expressed. Words are merely signposts at this point. Manifest is the citadel of human consciousness and evolution.

Collective

What is Manifest not? We aren’t a new-age cult. We are results-driven, “show me the numbers” type people, we seek to understand reality, we seek to accomplish all of our goals for ourselves, our families, our communities, our planet, and the universe at large.

You will not find hippies meditating on crystals, you will find like-minded passionate strivers to help you straight to the top of the games you wish to play. We mobilize, we take action, and finally, we “act as if” we are already who we wish to be, and so we are.

With that being said, we have a new way to organize our DAO, or as we call it, our Collective. It’s blank. A blank canvas of community.
You choose how you want to structure the Collective, you choose what you want the collective to be.

We allowed the most long-term human beings to be apart of our mint. We trust you. We’re so grateful for Olympus, it changed our lives. This project is our show of gratitude.

To become a part of our collective, simply reach out to The Vortex or Vibe Curators, share a bit about yourself and we’ll get you set up :)

With Love,
The Vortex

People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.
— Steve Jobs, 1997

Manifesters,

Within one week, the Manifest Discord has over 600 members, 100 boosts, 40 collective manifesters, and 3 collective projects. All of this, without even knowing what Manifest is.

Well, it’s time - Manifest is a decentralized streetwear collective using OHM economics of logarithmic supply growth, and exponential demand growth to be the leading metaverse clothing brand and real-world crypto streetwear company.

Manifest balances the spiritual and the physical by allowing you to show up in the real world, how you show up in the metaverse. Not only will you be able to equip our ERC1155 NFTs in the virtual worlds that support clothing, but you will also be able to claim our physical hoodies so you can be dripped out in the metaverse as well in real life.

The entirety of Manifest will be following a DAO-first governance approach. We value community, incentives, and protocol mechanisms to ensure the long-term success of Manifest.

Manifest provides incentives using MNFST, which can be staked for rebasing sMNFST, which rebases every 8 hours compounding at an APY of 333,333%. MNFST is also used to provide liquidity to MNFST/NFT pools where if you stake your NFT, you can earn MNFST on each buy/sell to the pool. MNFST is used to mint new clothing NFTs allowing us to sustainably grow our supply of clothing and maintain its rarity, based on the supply of MNFST.

There are two main protocol mechanisms - APY percentage and MNFST required to mint one of our NFTs. The APY can be raised or lowered depending on our runway of treasury assets, and MNFST required to mint can be changed based on how much supply/demand there is for a certain collection, to ensure all of our clothing remains perpetually highly valued and sought after.

Manifest will have a marketplace of various MNFST/NFT pools spanning our vast collections with each item having its own pool, therefore meaning you will always have an open market to buy/sell/stake your NFT for MNFST. This adds vast utility for MNFST, you need it to seed liquidity for all our NFT pools, for all of the liquidity pools, for staking and rebasing, for minting new NFTs, and utility will continue to be added as we progress in our development.

The Vortex

The team has been acquiring talent across all spectrums: development, artists, and 3D modeling, we want to focus on having a top-notch development team to help us build out this marketplace and front-end, all physical hoodies will have QR codes that can be scanned to verify authenticity on-chain, derived from the transaction hash of the mint.

This scanning would open up a Manifest front-end showing all previous owners, and verifying authenticity and ownership, to sell the physical hoodie you would have to sell the associated NFT to prove authenticity and ownership.

We’ve been focusing on hiring artists and designers that align with our vision to create intuitive, sleek products that are easy to use without complications. We’ll have our in-house Manifest seasonal drops. On top of that, we’ll also be doing plenty of collabs and allowing other protocols to offer to launch their collections on Manifest.

To launch on Manifest, they would have a designer assigned to them to work with their designers to bring their vision to reality, they would have manufacturing and distribution handled through Manifest and just take home a percentage of MNFST negotiated by the Collective.

Manifest Community

By aligning incentives, financially, spiritually, socially, and intellectually, people will naturally WANT to spend time hanging out with us. We’ve already had over 600 people join and have active conversations every day in our Discord without even announcing a project or what we were even working on.
We’ve tested our experiment, and our hypothesis was correct. The best way to build a community is through 1-on-1 conversations with deep empathy. We’ve gotten tons of DMs of support and tons of great messages for what Manifest is already doing for them, and how aligned they feel with our vision without even knowing what we’re building.

Building our Manifest flagship store in the Metaverse, we create an environment where you can casually hang out and explore with your friends, this gamification and experiencing our store together builds bonds and we’ve all known friends that we’ve met online.

Throwing Manifest parties we can create many synchronizations and connect the dots between many new people in real life. You can truly spend time with your online friends, or meet new ones, and what better place to make friends and new connections than a party!

Creating Manifest Academy we can educate and elevate our community, keeping them around for more than just rebases and streetwear, they can get educated following curated, gamified learning resources from Manifesters to learn any skill and any topic, without any of the filler and getting you up to speed with only what you need to know.

We created a blank canvas of community and told people “Hey, you guys decide what you want to work on and we’ll just support you in making it happen.” We’ve seen three projects come out of that. A policy team formed, a translation team (over 6 languages!) and Manifest Academy evolved from resource curation to gamified learning.

Manifest Incentives

The NFT sale is the MNFST sale. We’ve always thought simplicity is the truth and we’ve proved it again through our actions. Manifest’s sale of MNFST will be done through our Genesis Hoodie NFTs.

In total, there are 999 NFTs with 333 NFTs of each of the 3 hoodie designs. Only 666 will be available for public sale, 222 of each of the three designs.
The team will retain 90 out of 333 NFTs. Equivalent to 2970 MNFST out of 32967 outstanding MNFST supply.
The remaining 243 NFTs will be kept within our treasury to seed our Genesis Pools where you will be able to stake your NFTs to earn MNFST anytime a buy or sell is done within the pool.

The associated 8019 MNFST will remain in the treasury staked earning rebases and used to own our liquidity on Sushiswap.
Buying one of these NFTs for 0.333 ETH automatically stakes 33 sMNFST for you. If you mint three NFTs, you will automatically have 99 sMNFST staked. Each NFT adds 33 sMNFST to your account.

The best game-theoretic strategy is tit-for-tat with cooperation first. We ensure from genesis that 100% of MNFST are staked programmatically and incentivized to stay staked (you have to pay gas fees to unstake!)

We own all our protocol liquidity, we will own our entire MNFST-OHM LP pool from the very beginning, all fees turn into a revenue source for the Manifest treasury.
OHM is the decentralized reserve currency used by Manifest. We bring Zeus’s original vision to life by backing our entire treasury by OHM; it requires 0.001 OHM/sOHM to mint 1 MNFST. Manifest will launch with three bonds which are WETH, OHM, and MNFST-OHM LP.

By being powered by OHM, we use one of the best incentive structures and get exposure to the best parts of DeFi while having our entire treasury (3,3) earning rebases and growing not only in MNFST, but also in OHM.

All of our websites will display “Powered by OHM” at the bottom of the page. We truly believe Olympus is the best decentralized bank, and we’re the first real-world business to open an account. We look forward to being one of the largest OHM holders.

Manifest Mechanisms

Our initial policy for genesis stands as the chart below.

Once we reach 333,333 MNFST supply, our APY reduction will go into effect in approximately 120 days around the launch our 2022 Season 1 Spring collection
By launching only 33,000 MNFST, we fulfill our needs of raising enough capital to fund our development and keep building, we raise enough to seed our LP, and we raise enough to seed our MNFST/LP pools.

By Season 1, when Manifest will have greater demand and more than 999 NFTs being released, the Collective can use our second protocol mechanism to set how much MNFST is required to mint one of the NFTs.

If our demand is high, we can raise the amount of MNFST required to mint, therefore regulating supply and demand. Drops can be time-limited, meaning unlimited NFTs can be sold within a certain period of time. Or, drops can be limited, meaning there’s a set supply of outstanding NFTs that can be minted. All of these factors go into consideration when deciding how much MNFST to charge for each NFT.

Manifest in the Real-World

Manifest will use the mimetic value from having a successful protocol to get into rooms with artists, designers, rappers, and streetwear veterans to do collaborations often. We believe we can perpetually build hype by doing crazier and crazier collabs, sparking a flywheel effect of growth in the treasury and the value of MNFST.

We’ll use our real-world LLC to sign manufacturing contracts and meet all the requirements to create our physical hoodies and merch for other protocols that want to ship on Manifest. We’ll set up our own distribution and ensure everyone gets their Manifest hoodies when claiming is released.
Manifest turns everyone into a business, a franchise, a cooperating component of the Becoming of Manifest’s Vision. By allowing you to rebase MNFST, you can use the MNFST to sell back to the liquidity pool, claim NFTs to flip on Opensea/Rarible, or stake the NFTs in our pool, and you can also claim the physical clothing to sell in real life.

Manifest Checkout & Shipping

Our NFTs are ERC1155 meaning they can be batch transferred, we want to ideally create a similar shopping experience to carts, you will be able to add multiple articles of clothing from different pools and collections into one checkout cart, fill out your sizing guidelines, and address, and have everything shipped to you at once.

We’re nearing genesis, Our Discord has plenty of information for those aligned enough to manifest it. Everything in Perfect Timing. Here’s an example of Perfect Timing, if you are reading this you are energetically aligned with Manifest, there’s no such thing as a coincidence.

Manifesters,

We’ve reached 2000 followers on Twitter, over 1.3k humans on Manifest’s server, and more than 360 boosts. Thank you for the meaningful interactions, the amount of contribution, and for attracting an amazing group of individuals to our collective.

Phases

Manifest launches in three phases, the first phase is staking and bonding launching at the same time as the genesis drop. We’re launching the SΞAS0N 0: GΞNΞS1S drop, staking, and bonding on Friday, November 26th.

The second phase is MNFST/NFT pools allowing users to sell/buy/stake their NFTs. Guaranteed liquidity if you’re selling your NFT, easy way to buy if you want a hoodie, and a way to earn MNFST if you just want to stake your hoodie in the pool.

The third phase is an easy-to-use frontend to claim your physical clothing. Swapping your NFT for a claimed version of the NFT, that swap generating a transaction hash, then deriving a QR code from that transaction hash, and finally, stitching it onto the physical hoodie.
Then creating a simple user experience to submit your address, size, and email for confirmation & shipping updates.

Who can mint?

Minting will open at Perfect Timing on November 26th. Minting will be open to Manifesters that secured their spot through boosting or joining the Collective before November 9th, 3:33 PM EST. If you contributed after November 9th, we ensured that you have a spot. Learn more about the Collective here.
To all of the people who had one-on-one conversations with us, those that spoke with us on voice, and those that aligned themselves with Manifest, thank you. It’s high-priority to always reward missionaries over mercenaries.

There will be spots open to those that did not meet the criteria above, but still believe in the vision. Spots are awarded to those that standout by delivering value, for example: Getting @manifest handle on Instagram or putting us in contact with the owners of the Manifest.com domain.

About 300 Manifesters have secured their spot to mint, minting will be open until all 666 NFTs are sold out, with a max mint of three hoodies, and one max per transaction. There will be 666 hoodie NFTs available, with 222 of each hoodie design.

How does Manifest genesis work?

There are 999 NFTs total, 333 are reserved for the treasury & team, 90 of the 333 reserved NFTs will go to the team. This results in a 9% team, 24% treasury, and 67% public split.

Staking

If you mint the Genesis NFTs, you automagically receive 33 sMNFST, rebasing every eight hours compounding at 333,333% APY. Staked sMNFST can be unstaked for MNFST, which can be sold to the MNFST-OHM Sushiswap liquidity pool (LP) at any time. No restrictions, no lock-ups.

Bonding

Bonding will be available at launch as the second value accrual strategy, the first being the genesis mint, the second is bonds revenue on wETH, sOHM, and MNFST-OHM LP bonds.

As a user, be mindful that bonding is an active, short-term strategy and has a vesting term of five days before you can claim and stake your MNFST. By selling MNFST at a discount, we can acquire reserve assets into our treasury.

Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL)

The MNFST-OHM Sushiswap pool is another revenue stream. By being the largest liquidity provider, we earn most of the fees on swaps in the MNFST-OHM liquidity pool.
Why Manifest

OHM is our reserve currency (1 MNFST is backed by 0.001 OHM), all OHM in treasury is staked (3,3), and all MNFST is staked from the beginning by default. We are a brand and Olympus is the bank.

It’s important to note, by using OHM as Manifest’s reserve currency we get exposure to the best parts of DeFi. They handle the curation of the best assets (wETH, DAI, FRAX, LUSD, CVX, and more) to acquire into their treasury. By acquiring OHM, we automatically get exposure to a basket of the best assets in DeFi.
This allows us to simplify Manifest’s treasury by only holding OHM, ETH, and MNFST and focus on core products by choosing Olympus as both the decentralized reserve currency, and bank.

MNFST is 100% staked at the beginning by the genesis NFT sale also being the MNFST sale, and automatically stake 33 sMNFST on your behalf per each NFT that you mint. Cooperation is incentivized, to unstake you must pay gas fees. Learn more about our Policy here.

Thank you — The Vortex

One sale, one genesis event, and one focus on rewarding the people that deserve it. Simplicity, focus, and speed are core values of Manifest. Thank you for being apart of the Becoming of Manifest. We appreciate you.

With Love,
The Vortex
